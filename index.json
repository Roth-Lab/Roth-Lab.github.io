[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Dr. Andrew Roth, PhD (UBC) is an assistant professor in the Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Computer Science. His interdisciplinary research focuses on the application of statistical machine learning to problems in high dimensional cancer biology. This research program encompasses the development of computational methods for studying clonal population structures and tumour evolution, as well as methodological work in computational statistics. His work in computational biology has been published in Nature Methods and applied in high profile studies of breast and ovarian cancer published in Nature and Nature Genetics. Dr. Roth will provide expertise in bioinformatics analysis. In particular, he will focus on developing computational approaches for studying the spatial and temporal dynamics of the malignant-cell immune interface.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"491a35b91678cdec142ee63377231732","permalink":"https://roth-lab.github.io/authors/aroth/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/aroth/","section":"authors","summary":"Dr. Andrew Roth, PhD (UBC) is an assistant professor in the Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and Computer Science.
